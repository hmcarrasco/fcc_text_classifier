# Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

This repository contains the Neural Network SMS Text Classifier project developed during the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning course.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). A neural network is used to train the model with a dataset of labeled SMS messages.
